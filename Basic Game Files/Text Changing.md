as you can see on this image, theres some texts that we dont understand. What is it?
These texts are basically the game's some texts. Every brawler's info, every button's text, every quick message is located on this file.
So lets know how to edit them:

First, find a text that u wanna change.

So you see the "TID_SHOTGUN_GIRL" right? we not gonna change that text but the text on right which is:
"SHELLY"
We gonna change that.
What is the "SHELLY" thing tho?
Its actually the first characters name in the game(idk what im saying its actually a characters name we gonna change that). So we gonna change that.
