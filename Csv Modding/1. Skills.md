Hi! Welcome to the new tutorial. In this tutorial folder we gonna learn how to edit csv files!
Lets get started!

First of all, we need to know what these things do:

(and more)

So, i will list down the meanings of those things down below:

BehaviorType: So think theres 2 characters. One is Shelly. Second one is leon. Leon ulti's behavior type is Invisibility. But shellys ulti's behavior type is attack. which is means when leon presses his ulti he will turn Invisibile. But when shelly presses his ulti, she will just shoot some bullets.

CanMoveAtTheSameTime: did you ever noticed when we use frank but when we use his attack we cannot move? yes thats because the value of it is false(empty actually). but if you do that "true", frank can move while he attacks!

CanAutoShoot: do you know how those colt mains know where u go and shoot u? Yes! thats because of "CanAutoShoot"! When you do the value "false" of that, the character cannot auto shoot no more!

CastingRange: Sets the length of the attack
### Example

(PLAYER) -------------------
              ^ Range

RechargeTime: No need to explain. You already understand that.

MaxCharge: How much Charge does character have(Default is 3 but if u do it 0 it will be infinite).

Damage: How much damage does characters attack does(Per projectile).

MsBetweenAttacks: How fast of the attack is(i guess).

Spread: How much wide of the attack is.
### Example

            /      
          /
(PLAYER) ------------
          \
           \

NumBulletsInOneAttack: How much projectile does attack will have in per attack.

### Now we know what those things are doing, you can simply start to edit the values of it and mess with the characters!

And Thats it!

See you in the next tutorial!
